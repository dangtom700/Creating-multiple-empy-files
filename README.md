# Creating-multiple-empy-files

This is for my own interest of how to create files by using different languages. In this case, I am using C++, Python and Java to create a list of unique files under diffrenet directories. 
In this particular case, I want to create a bunch of files beforehand, so that I can jump in right away to solve Advent of Code problems. 
How it works:
- Every folders and files are created under the same folder, called MAIN_ROOT
- Under the MAIN_ROOT folder, there are multiple folders that contain the name "Advent_of_code_" with a number that corelated to the year (staring from 2015 to the current year). Under each of those folder, there are mulitple sub-folder that contains the name of its parent folder + "_" + the date (from day1 to day25). Under each sub-folder, there are files created beforehand.
There are two options for creating files:
- creating empyty files to have maximum flexiblity in writing code
- duplicating an exiting template to make ease of coding
